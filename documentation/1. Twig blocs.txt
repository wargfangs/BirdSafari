Main layout: /app/Resources/views/MainLayout.html.twig
	You need to add the following blocs in order to match the main layout.
Sub layouts can inherit from the following blocs from MainLayout.html.twig:
	title:		Where you can change the text in the navigator tab. Parent declares "BirdSafari". 
	css:		Where you have to put any specific css for your page. E.G.: A map special css. Parent declares bootstrap.css and mainStyle.css
	body:		Where you can write the body code. It is always underneath the main menu bar code.
	foot:		Where you can add some footer content.
	js:		Where you can put some more javascript content. Parent declares Jquery.js and bootstrap.js


Sub layouts of blogLayout.html.twig: All the above except body:
    sider:      Left part of the site's blog.
    content:    replace the body content in the blog.


Sub layouts of observationLayout.html.twig: All the MainLayout blocks are usable, avoid body, except for overriding the following blocks
    search:     Where the search bar should be placed.
    sideMenu:   Where the result of the search should appear. (Or the observation text or form itself)
    content:    Where the map and results should appear. Every pages of ObservationBundle require the map to work correctly. Defaults has the map initialized. use {{ parent()}} to keep the original block content while overriding.
